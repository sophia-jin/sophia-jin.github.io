										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Hi! I'm Sophia and I'm a Master's student at Stanford University studying
										Computer Science with a concetration in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I also earned my
										Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy at Stanford. My background in the humanities makes me
										interested in how technology interacts with its users and communities, which is why I decided to
										pursue HCI. My interest in interdisciplinary learning has also given me a diverse array of interests,
										like coding, design, art, and writing. Here you can find some of the projects I've worked on that
										showcase my interest in these topics!</p>

								<h3>Coding Projects</h3>
								<p>My education has familiarized me with coding langauges like C, C++, Python, JavaScript, and R.
									Here are a few of the projects I've worked on as a Computer Science student. Code is not displayed per the Stanford Honor Code,
									but is available upon request.

											<h4>Chatbot</h4>
											<p>As part of the class "CS 124: From Languages to Information", I worked with a group of four students
												to implement a working movie-recommender chatbot in Python using natural language processing. Our chatbot, named Cass,
												provided movie recommendations based on user input and item-item collaborative filtering, and included typo-checking, multiple movie input,
												and sentiment extraction. You can view a live demo of what an interaction with Cass might look like!

											<h4>Implicit Heap Allocator</h4>
											<p>As part of "CS 107: Computer Organization and Systems", I created an implicit heap allocator in C
												that included a first-fit method using headers and reallocation. Code available upon request.

											<h4>Scrabble Solver</h4>
											<p>As a self-guided final project in "CS 106B: Programming Abstractions", I created a program in C++ that
												utilized recursive backtracking to find the highest scoring words in the word game "Scrabble".
